RPSL-Parser 
========================

RPSL Stands for Router Policy Specification Language, and it's described by
RFC2622. This is a simple lexer and parser for RPSL objects, writen in Pure
Perl.

This parser doesn't include any validation rules, and doesn't implement all the
RFC 2622. It can parse most part of the defined RPSL objects and give you back
a fancy perl structure that represents the provided object.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES
